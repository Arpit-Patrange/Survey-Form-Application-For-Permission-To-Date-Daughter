# Survey-Form-Type-1
Forms are always an essential part of any project and we will be working with a lot of forms in most of the applications.
so  I created  a normal survey form to ask a permission to a date a girl. 
How to use a text field, checkbox, radio button, date, and other important elements in a single form. I learn how to give a proper structure to a webpage while creating a form. 
Knowledge of HTML/HTML5 is good enough but  I can use a bit of CSS to make the project look better.
